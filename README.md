*OUR FEATURES*


#### Web-based catalog: BookHive is accessible through a web browser, indicating that it is an online platform rather than a traditional software installed on library computers. This means that users can access the catalog from any device with an internet connection, offering convenience and flexibility.

#### Tailored for local libraries: BookHive is designed specifically for use by local libraries, implying that it is customizable to meet the needs and preferences of individual library systems. This tailored approach may include features such as customizable search options, local library branding, and integration with existing library systems.

#### Intuitive search functionalities: BookHive provides search tools that are user-friendly and easy to use. This could include features such as keyword search, advanced search filters, and recommendations based on user preferences or browsing history. The emphasis on intuitiveness suggests that the system is designed to be straightforward and efficient for library patrons.

#### Real-time availability status for books: One of the key features of BookHive is its ability to display the current availability status of books in the library's collection in real-time. This means that users can see whether a book is currently available for checkout, on hold, or checked out by another patron before visiting the library in person. Real-time availability information helps users make informed decisions about which books to borrow and reduces frustration caused by outdated or inaccurate catalog information.
